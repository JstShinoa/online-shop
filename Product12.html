            <h2>ASUS RT-AX52 AX1800 Dual Band WiFi 6 Router</h2>
            <p>₱1,700.00</p>
            <p>WiFi 6 includes a new feature called BSS Coloring that improves WiFi connection efficiency even in crowded environments. When two neighboring routers send traffic on the same channel, your router has to wait until the channel is free. With BSS Coloring, your WiFi 6 router identifies its data with a unique channel tag ('color') that's different from neighboring networks. Your WiFi 6 router can then ignore other-colored signals on the channel and send data immediately.* This greatly reduces router waiting times and boosts network efficiency.</p>
